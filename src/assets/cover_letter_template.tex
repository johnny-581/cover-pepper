    \textbf{Re: [Role Title]} \\
    
    Dear [Hiring Manager], \\
     
    I’m a third-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for technology, and I’m excited to apply for the QA position at [Company]. I’m drawn to this role by its deep involvement in the software testing lifecycle and the opportunity for interpersonal collaboration with clients and colleagues—areas where I thrive. \\
    
    My experience with various testing frameworks and methodologies has equipped me to excel in QA roles. While developing the Expense Tracker App, I implemented a complete JUnit test suite achieving 100\% code coverage, alongside robust error handling and input validation using Regex. For the Campus Explorer project, I wrote over 200 unit and integration tests using Mocha.js and Chai.js, which significantly improved system reliability and delivered a seamless user experience. \\
    
    At nwHacks, my team’s project Access Buddy won the Potential Community Impact award. I integrated APIs like Vosk, OpenAI, and PyAutoGUI to turn voice commands into web actions, implementing audio input caching and native browser feedback using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. This exemplified applying technical skills to solve real problems. \\
    
    Beyond coding, I’m comfortable communicating with diverse groups. As an HR Coordinator with the UBC Science Undergraduate Society, I led the recruitment and training of over 50 volunteers. I also served as an Imagine Day Orientation Leader, helping first-year students feel welcomed—both roles sharpened my communication and problem-solving skills. \\
    
    I'd love to contribute to and learn from the [Company] community. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team's needs. Thank you for considering my application. \\
    
    Sincerely, \\
    Jiayang Dong
