    \textbf{Re: Software Engineer Co-op}
    
    Dear Ahmad Sidiqi,
     
    I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a passionate interest in web development, and I'm excited to apply for the SWE position at Checker Software. As a user of the SVGViewer and Diffchecker myself, I'm eager to contribute my web development skills to these impactful tools that millions rely on.
    
    At nwHacks, my team's project Access Buddy won the Potential Community Impact award. I integrated APIs like Vosk, OpenAI, and PyAutoGUI to turn voice commands into web actions, implementing audio input caching and native browser feedback. In CPSC 310, I earned the highest grading category on every project checkpoint with an 86\% final grade, demonstrating my proficiency in TypeScript, React, and full-stack development.
    
    Recently, I’ve been developing a website for Under One Sky, a UBC initiative, using next.js, managing the complete project lifecycle from initial branding and design on Figma to final deployment on Vercel. This experience has taught me that quality web development is an iterative process requiring attention to both technical implementation and user feedback.
    
    My leadership experiences complement my technical skills. As an HR Coordinator with the UBC Science Undergraduate Society, I led the recruitment and training of over 50 volunteers. I also served as an UBC Imagine Day Orientation Leader, helping first-year students feel welcome—both roles sharpened my communication and problem-solving skills.
    
    I'm specifically drawn to startup environments where I can take on greater responsibility and contribute to decision-making. Your clean UI design and focus on user-centered tools resonates with my design philosophy. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team's needs. Thank you for considering my application.
    
    Sincerely, \\
    Jiayang Dong
